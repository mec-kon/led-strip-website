led-strip-website
====================================

This is a website that allows you to control a Led strip connected to a Raspberry Pi or ESP32 microcontroller.

Modes
--------

Three different modes are currently available.
* The one color mode allows you to select a simple color.
* The fade mode can be used to select several colors between which the color 
of the LED strip moves.
* The changing colors mode switches between all selected colors.

Download and install
--------

The easiest way to run the website is to use my self-programmed [server](https://github.com/mec-kon/led-strip-server), 
as it not only hosts the website, but also controls the Led Band.
This project is already included in my [server](https://github.com/mec-kon/led-strip-server) project as submodule.
